## üìö API Documentation

This project uses the Booking.com API via RapidAPI for fetching hotel information:

- **API Name**: Booking.com API (via RapidAPI)
- **Endpoint Used**: `https://apidojo-booking-v1.p.rapidapi.com/properties/list-by-map`
- **Documentation**: [Booking.com API on RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/booking)

The API provides comprehensive hotel data including pricing, availability, amenities, and review scores.

---

## üíª Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Web browser
- Text editor or IDE
- API key from RapidAPI for the Booking.com API

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VeronicahWanjuu/TravelMadeEasy.git
   cd TravelMadeEasy
   ```

3. Open verosales.tech in your browser to run the application locally.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Deployment Architecture

The application is deployed on two web servers behind a load balancer to ensure high availability and efficient traffic distribution.

### Web Servers

- **Web01**: Ubuntu server at IP 35.171.163.227
- **Web02**: Ubuntu server at IP 34.207.192.59

### Load Balancer

- **LB01**: Ubuntu server at IP 18.206.137.18 (Nginx)

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Load Balancer Configuration

The load balancer was configured using Nginx to distribute traffic evenly between Web01 and Web02 using a round-robin algorithm.

### Steps Taken for Load Balancer Configuration:

1. **Install Nginx on the load balancer server**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nginx
   ```

2. **Configure Nginx as a load balancer**:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/travel-made-easy
   ```

3. **Add the following configuration**:
   ```nginx
   upstream backend {
       server 35.171.163.227;  # Web01
       server 34.207.192.59;   # Web02
   }

   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name 18.206.137.18 verosales.tech;  # Load balancer IP and domain

       location / {
           proxy_pass http://backend;
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Enable the site and restart Nginx**:
   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/travel-made-easy /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
   sudo nginx -t  # Test configuration
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

## Web Server Deployment Steps

1. **Set up web servers**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nginx
   ```

2. **Clone repository on both web servers**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TravelMadeEasy.git   ```

3. **Configure web server document root**:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/TravelMadeEasy
   ```
   
   Add the following configuration:
   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       root /path/to/travel-made-easy;
       index index.html;
       
       location / {
           try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Enable the site and restart Nginx**:
   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/TravelMadeEasy /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
   sudo nginx -t
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

5. **Ensure API key is securely configured** on each server in the `config.js` file.

---

## üìä Load Test Results

To verify the load balancer was functioning correctly, a load test was performed with the following results:

- **Web01 Requests**: 1251
- **Web02 Requests**: 1248

This confirms that the load balancer is effectively distributing traffic between both web servers in a near-equal manner.

---

## üöß Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: API Key Security

**Problem**: The API key needed to be kept secure but accessible to the application.

**Solution**: Implemented a separate `config.js` file that is included in `.gitignore` to prevent committing sensitive information to the repository. For deployment, this file was securely transferred to each server.

### Challenge 2: Date Validation

**Problem**: Users could select invalid date ranges for their hotel searches.

**Solution**: Implemented client-side validation to ensure departure dates are after arrival dates and that past dates cannot be selected.
